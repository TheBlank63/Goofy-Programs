# Goofy-Programs
This is where I store my goofy ahh programs.

## Programs
* Math standard deviation program
  This program takes all the values from the .txt file and compile the x, x^2, variance, and standard deviation. (Ungrouped method)

* Version checker program
  This is a better attempt for one of my interview questions, because my brain pooped itself when attempting live.
